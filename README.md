<h1>Squirrel</h1>

<p>
  Squirrel is a school project about cyber physical systems, edge computing and home automation.
  
  The general idea is to collect data using a microcontroller (ESP8266 in this case) and collect them in a database (MariaDB in this case).
  This is achived using the MQTT protocol to get the data off the microcontroller. The <b>Squirrel.py</b> python script acts as an interface between MQTT and MYSQL
